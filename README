Howdy!

This here's Essai, a git-versioned way to keep track of your essays for classes with
ease. You'll be able to look at all of your revisions, and generate PDFs of any of them, fork from a past revision, or print that particular revision. I'm primarily a UI designer, so
it will, of course, be pretty. The overall theme will be that of a bento box.

Here's the general overview of the UI:

You have a main area with your various projects in their own filed compartments: active, recent, finished, and graveyard. The active area is self explanatory. The recent are essays you've worked on recently, finished is for essays already turned in, and the graveyard is for
essays never to see the light of day.

Each essay will have its own workspace. Google Docs integration might be possible, and so
might a WYSIWYG, though the latter is unlikely. You'll have a little revision history here,
and you'll be able to do all of your normal Git tasks from a nice web GUI.

At this time, I'm not planning on letting you turn in your assignments using this system.
It's presently only for students to keep track of things. That's not to say a school or college
wouldn't find this system helpful for its students, it's just not a forum for turning things in
yet. If somebody wants to help with this, message me.
